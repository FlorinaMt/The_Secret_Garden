## Requirements

Object: One net

Behavior: The net should follow the cursor around in the garden at all times.


Object: One blue butterfly

Behavior 1: Whenever you try to move the mouse cursor over the blue butterfly, it will swiftly move to a random location inside the view of the garden, but always staying inside the view of the garden – i.e. not moving outside the browser window .

Behavior 2: When the blue butterfly is not otherwise being interacted with, it will slowly move around in random directions on its own – again, never moving outside the garden.


Object: Three apples

Behavior: Each apple is placed at a random position in the crown of the tree every time the garden loads. When an apple is clicked, it moves in a straight line into the basket. The apples should be placed INSIDE the basket.


Object: One watering can

Behavior: When the watering can is clicked, it should shift to a tilted position, and when it is clicked again it should go back to the initial (normal) position.


Object: Three water drops

Behavior: The water drops should be hidden until the watering can is in a tilted position. When the watering can is in a tilted position, the water drops should appear from the tip of the watering can and move down in a straight line and exit at the bottom of the screen. When a water drop moves out of view in the bottom, it will enter anew by the tip of the watering can and move downward in a straight line. This behavior should continue until the watering can is no longer in a tilted position. 


Implement at least one extra feature/functionality to each object.

### Extra functionality: 
- net turning around depending on cursor's moving direction
- buttlerfly moving in the basket when clicked
-
